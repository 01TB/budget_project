Technology : Python 3.13
Framework : Django
IDE : PyCharm
Database : Postgres (PostgreSQL) 17.2
CSS : Tailwind
Objectives : Create a web application that allows me to predict the budget needed to: rent a house or apartment, or buy land.

There will be 2 main pages in this website :
    - Page 1 : to predict the necessary budget for renting a house or an apartment
    - Page 2 : to predict the necessary budget for buying a land
A third page will be the host page :  in order to select the page the client would like to go

There are several criteria when choosing a house or apartment to rent :
    - type of access :
        - without access
        - motocycle access
        - car access
        - car access + parking

                - F3
                - F4
                - F5
                - F6
            - convenience :
                - showers & toilets
                - garage
                - garden
                - house basement
                - parking
                - surveillance system
                - dishwasher
                - washing machine
                - internet access
    - town :
        - special feature: the city must be selected on a map.
        - the client has to click on the city on the map to select the desired city.
        - Give e instructions on how to connect the town on map with my Database

There are also several criteria for choosing the land to buy
    - paper type (it should be in french) :
        - titre de propriété
        - acte juridique
        - plan cadastre
    - type of access :
        - without access
        - motocycle access
        - car access
        - car access + parking
    - Fenced :
        - yes
        - no
    - Ready to build :
        - yes
        - no
    - town :
        - special feature: the city must be selected on a map.
        - the client has to click on the city on the map to select the desired city.
        - Give e instructions on how to connect the town on map with my Database

When the client use the website :
    - he will complete each field : for renting a house/apartment OR buying a land

Particularity of the prediction : Use linear regression to make the prediction
So I will need :

    A dataset (often stored in a database table).

    A dependent variable (what you want to predict) --> the price.

    One or more independent variables (predictors).

    A trained linear regression model (built using your dataset).

    Guide me on how to train the model.

Create also a CRUD page for houses for rent, apartments for rent and land for sale
Create also a possibility to import these data directly as CSV files (a csv for each model).
Don't forget to explain the csv structure for each model.

Give me all the code and all the needed instructions to make this project.
Make a complete database structure adapted to my project.
Don't forget to explain me how to make the Tailwind CSS work.
